# PDF From Scratch

An attempt to learn the PDF format and write minimal PDFs.
The goal of the project is to be able to take accept
some basic markdown and print it in a PDF and have it look decent.

When the application is passed a PDF file instead of a Markdown file,
it should convert it back to markdown assuming it was produced with
this application.
